## My Apps
Here are the applications I have created using the Hyperbolic Labs API. Each app highlights a different use case and offers a valuable insight into the flexibility of the platform. You can find the repositories, relevant files, and documentation for each project below:

1. Image Generation App
* Description: This app generates images based on text prompts, using the Hyperbolic API's image generation capabilities.
* Key Features:
* Generates 100 different `images` from a list of prompts.
* Uses a random pause interval between requests to avoid API rate limits.
* Repository: [Image Generation Repo](https://github.com/CryptoAirdropHindi/Imagebot.app)
* Files:
* `Imagebot.Py` – Script to interact with the API and generate images.
* `prompts.txt` – A list of 100 different prompts used for image generation

2. Text-to-Audio App
* Description: This app converts a set of text phrases into audio files using the Hyperbolic API's text-to-speech capabilities.
* Key Features:
* Takes 100 different text phrases as input and generates corresponding audio files.
* Saves each audio file locally in `.mp3` format.
* Pauses for a random time between 60 and 120 seconds between each request to avoid hitting rate limits.
* Repository: [Text-to-Audio Repo](https://github.com/CryptoAirdropHindi/audiobot.app)
* Files:
* `audiobot.py` – Script to interact with the API and generate audio from text.
* `texts.txt` – A list of 100 text phrases used for audio generation.

3. Language Processing App
* Description: This app processes `text` inputs to analyze sentiment, generate summaries, or translate between languages using Hyperbolic's NLP tools.
* Key Features:
* Perform sentiment analysis on text.
* Generate summaries of long articles.
* Translate text between multiple languages.
* Repository: [Language Processing Repo](https://github.com/CryptoAirdropHindi/Chatbot-app)
* Files:
* `Chatbot.py` – Script to interact with the API for language processing tasks.
* `examples.txt` – Sample texts used for testing various language processing features.
